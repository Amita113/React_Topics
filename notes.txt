useRef
useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering.

Usage
Referencing a value with a ref
Manipulating the DOM with a ref
Avoiding recreating the ref contents

Parameters 
initialValue: The value you want the ref object’s current property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.

Returns 
useRef returns an object with a single property:

current: Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.
On the next renders, useRef will return the same object.
